# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

Welcome to my repository for the **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification** from freeCodeCamp. This repository contains all the projects and exercises I have completed during the certification program.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections:

### 1. `exercises/`

This folder contains all the preparatory exercises that I completed before working on the certification projects. These exercises help build foundational skills in algorithms and data structures.

Example structure:

```plaintext
exercises/
â”œâ”€â”€ pyramid-generator/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # Explanation of the exercise
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pyramid-generator.js  # Code implementation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test.js               # Optional test cases
â”œâ”€â”€ gradebook-app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gradebook-app.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test.js
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### 2. `projects/`

This folder contains the final projects required for the certification. Each project solves a specific problem and demonstrates key concepts in JavaScript algorithms and data structures.

Example structure:

```plaintext
projects/
â”œâ”€â”€ palindrome-checker/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md              # Project description
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ palindrome-checker.js  # Code implementation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test.js                # Optional test cases
â”œâ”€â”€ roman-numeral-converter/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ roman-numeral-converter.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test.js
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abelnnieva/javascript-algorithms-data-structures.git
   cd javascript-algorithms-data-structures
   ```

2. Explore the exercises and projects:

   - Navigate to `exercises/` to see foundational exercises.
   - Navigate to `projects/` for the certification projects.

3. Run any JavaScript file using Node.js:

   ```bash
   node exercises/pyramid-generator/pyramid-generator.js
   ```

4. (Optional) Run tests if available:
   ```bash
   node exercises/pyramid-generator/test.js
   ```

## Projects Included

### Certification Projects

- **Palindrome Checker**: Check if a given string is a palindrome.

### Exercises

- **Pyramid Generator**: Generate a pyramid of characters based on input.
- **Gradebook App**: Provide a simple set of functions to calculate class averages.
- **Role Playing Game**: Simple text-based adventure game where players fight monsters.
- **Random Color Background Changer**: Simple project to change the background color to a random color.
